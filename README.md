## üöÄ The Problem We're Solving

The Web3 industry faces a **trillion-dollar dilemma**: businesses need to comply with regulations while preserving user privacy. Current solutions force companies to choose between:

- **Privacy**: Using protocols like Tornado Cash that offer privacy but no compliance
- **Compliance**: Using centralized services that require full KYC but destroy privacy
- **Exclusion**: Avoiding regulated markets entirely, limiting growth potential

**85% of traditional businesses** cite compliance concerns as their #1 barrier to adopting Web3 technologies.
